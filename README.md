<h1 align="center">Intervyo – AI-Powered Interview Simulation Platform</h1>

Intervyo is an AI-driven interview preparation and evaluation platform designed to simulate real-world technical and HR interviews.  
It helps candidates practice interviews, receive structured, criteria-based feedback, and improve performance through AI analysis instead of vague human opinions.

This is not a generic “chat with AI” project.  
Intervyo is built for realism, accountability, and measurable improvement.

## 🎯 Why Intervyo Exists

Most interview preparation platforms fail because they:

- Ask generic questions  
- Give fluffy, non-actionable feedback  
- Do not simulate real interview pressure  

Intervyo fixes this by:

- Running structured interviews  
- Evaluating responses against defined criteria  
- Giving actionable feedback, not motivational nonsense  

If it doesn’t help you perform better in a real interview, it doesn’t belong here.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 📦 Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- MongoDB
- Git

---

### 📥 Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/santanu-atta03/Intervyo  
cd intervyo

---

### 🔧 Backend Setup
cd backend  
npm install  
npm run dev  

---

### 💻 Frontend Setup
cd frontend  
npm install  
npm run dev

---

### 🔑 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:

PORT=5000  
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string  
AI_API_KEY=your_ai_api_key  

---

## Docker (Optional)

This setup is for local development only and does not change the default workflows.

1) Create any needed backend env values (optional). The Docker Compose config uses
`Backend/.env.example` by default and overrides the MongoDB host.

2) Start the stack:
```
docker compose up --build
```

Frontend: http://localhost:5173  
Backend: http://localhost:5000  

If you want to point the frontend to a different API URL, set
`VITE_API_BASE_URL` before building.
