<h1 align="center">Intervyo – AI-Powered Interview Simulation Platform</h1>

Intervyo is an AI-driven interview preparation and evaluation platform designed to simulate real-world technical and HR interviews.  
It helps candidates practice interviews, receive structured, criteria-based feedback, and improve performance through AI analysis instead of vague human opinions.

This is not a generic “chat with AI” project.  
Intervyo is built for realism, accountability, and measurable improvement.

## 🎯 Why Intervyo Exists

Most interview preparation platforms fail because they:

- Ask generic questions  
- Give fluffy, non-actionable feedback  
- Do not simulate real interview pressure  

Intervyo fixes this by:

- Running structured interviews  
- Evaluating responses against defined criteria  
- Giving actionable feedback, not motivational nonsense  

If it doesn’t help you perform better in a real interview, it doesn’t belong here.
